export const correlationText = `The Correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variable It is a number between -1 and 1 The closer to 1, the stronger the correlation The closer to -1, the weaker the correlation The correlation coefficient is calculated by the formula`
export const correlationEquation = "r = Σ(𝑥−𝑥)(𝑦−𝑦)√Σ(𝑥−𝑥)2 Σ(𝑦−𝑦)2"

export const correlationEquation2 = "r1= Σ(𝑥−𝑥)(𝑦−𝑦)√Σ(𝑥−𝑥)2 Σ(𝑦−𝑦)2"
